SistrategiaDrive
==================
Sistrategia Drive provides business enterprise-grade cloud storage access. You can create storage on a variety of providers like Amazon S3, Azure Storage and Rackspace Cloud Files.

With enterprise-grade solution we mean:

* **Security** - A holistic approach across applications, infraestructure and processes.
* **Lifetime control** - File-level security in terms of securing important documents no matter where they travel, including mobile devices (Like DRM.)
* **Productivity** - Ensure that file-sharing across the enterprise and with partners is easy to use and adopt, and therefore not bypassed for costumer-grade services (Like dropbox.)
* **Integration** - Minimize disruption for end users by allowing them to keep using existing enterprise tools such as Microsoft Office, Active Directory, etc.
* **Policy management, reporting and administration** - Organizations need granular management of policies for sync, share and control at the user level, they need to be able to report enterprise-wide on everything that users have donde with valuable content and integrate effectively into existing enterprise compliance solutions and the overall information governance framework.
* **Support** - Now organizations also need to provide support to the "extended" organization that is now interacting with their content such as customers and partners, which has been a big inhibitor to previous attempts at externalization (e.g., Sharepoint).
